# Gryphons
gryphon management game

- Start with GP income, one gryphon, access to shop (blueprints and one-time items), Merchant profession
- Able to buy blueprints to different buildings, which unlocks other professions/breeding
- Use gryphon skills and stats to improve income in different buildings
- Distribute income from primary (GP) to building specific (MP, XP, BP, RP)
- Library/Mage Tower work similar to shop, with purchasables that improve various aspects of the game and professions that improve building specific income
- Unlockable breeding grounds to enable breeding between gryphons, which generates a new gryphon egg that can be sold or incubated; this egg will have stats influenced by the parents
- Four Stats that correspond with professions: Intelligence (Scholar/Library), Strength (Builder/building queue), Cunning (Merchant/Shop), Arcane (Mage/Mage Tower)
- Perhaps build a profession tree that improve different aspects of each building, depending on secondary stat
